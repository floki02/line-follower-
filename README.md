# line-follower-
This is my first project 

A line follower is a robot that can follow a line drawn on a surface. It uses sensors to detect the line and then adjust its movement to stay on the line. 
How it works 
The robot has sensors that detect the line
The sensors send information to the robot's controller
The controller uses the information to adjust the robot's motors
The motors move the robot's wheels
Applications 
Military: Line followers are used in military applications
Delivery: Line followers are used in delivery services
Automated production: Line followers are used in automated production processes
Restaurants: Line followers are used in restaurants
Hotels: Line followers are used in hotels
Bars: Line followers are used in bars
