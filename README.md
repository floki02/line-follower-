# line-follower-
This is my first project 

A line follower is a robot that can follow a line drawn on a surface. It uses sensors to detect the line and then adjust its movement to stay on the line.<br> 
***How it works*** <br>
The robot has sensors that detect the line<br>
The sensors send information to the robot's controller<br>
The controller uses the information to adjust the robot's motors<br>
The motors move the robot's wheels<br>
***Applications*** <br>
Military: Line followers are used in military applications<br>
Delivery: Line followers are used in delivery services<br>
Automated production: Line followers are used in automated production processes<br>
Restaurants: Line followers are used in restaurants<br>
Hotels: Line followers are used in hotels<br>
Bars: Line followers are used in bars<br>
